# basic-bot

A simple bot to kick-start Bot related projects

## Quickstart

1. Follow the [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started) to get a Discord Bot token.
2. Copy your token to a local `.env` file.
3. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` - it is advisable to set up a virtual env. More information [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
4. Run the command `python3 main.py` - you're bot should be alive!

> The `main` already includes some function to keep your bot alive using hosting tools such as [replit](https://replit.com/) and [uptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).
> The idea to use this platform came from this [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&t=3592s).
